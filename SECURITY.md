# Security & Supported versions

> Supported versions of DDX are as followed:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| v1.0.1  | âœ… Supported   |

## Why?

Having different versions is difficult to maintain and is costly. If you would
like to use a different version you may download it and host it on your own
repository.

# Current Version

The current version of DDX is **v1.0.1**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you do not have the current version of DDX please update
> your repository or things may not function correctly.

# Support

If you are having issues with your repository and/or its versions, you can
submit a discussion or open a ticket in our
[Discord](https://discord.night-x.com) and we will try to reach you as soon as possible.
